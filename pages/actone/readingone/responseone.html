	<h4>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</h4>

	<p>Lialina argues that using the word “user" as an umbrella term for both the developer and user is harmful in many ways. If the developer and user are one then creates loopholes for privacy breaches and results in people losing their rights as a user. She wants to keep this distinction between the two groups to avoid creating harmful loopholes such as not having a choice when using programs to allow or not allow access to certain information. Not throwing both words under the same bus doesn’t affect the evolution of making the computer invisible either.</p>
 

	<h4>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h4>

	<p>An ideal internet user or also known as a universal user is a unique someone who can reach their digital goals by choosing to use programs/technology available to them however not limited to them. One example, she discussed was you can decide how you want to blog about your day. Some individuals use existing platforms while others create their own. The concept is the same but each has their method of execution. The permitters set by applications and programs do not limit the ideal internet user from doing what they have to do.<p>
 

	<h4>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h4>

	<p>An example of gaps being filled up by the user would be when a user creates a profile or account on any online platforms. They are prompted to enter information to continue sometimes required fields and sometimes optional. When buying stuff online nowadays, for instance, Shopify, you enter your basic personal information and then you have to fill out shipping address. Even if the field has become more automatic the user must first enter the country and province or the website to show your address as a drop-down menu. As you type your address the searches narrow down as well.<p>
