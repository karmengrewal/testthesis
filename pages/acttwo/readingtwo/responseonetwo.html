	<h4>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h4>

	<p>I think by asking us to 'defamiliarize our tools’, Seu is asking of us to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Technology is a tool that has been embedded into our daily lives and we blindside its true potential by using it in an automated way. I think she’s asking the audience to look deeper into these tools we use everyday and understand the they are not just a tool but a communication language of its own. She uses poetry to relate back to the concept of 'defamiliarize our tools’. Poetry like these tools has multiple levels of understanding or multiple layers of information that go beyond the primary functionally off the tool. You can’t grasp the meaning of the words the first time but have to go back and consciously see through the words. Essentially, Sue is saying to use a more discrete lens or using a different perspective when looking at these tools.</p>
 

	<h4>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h4>

	<p>Performing data is one of the 6 tools mentioned in the article. Performing data is a way to showcase statistics and information in a unique visual format so the viewer can understand what they are seeing. This could mean using existing data to create a new data and presentation for better understanding.  

	An example of performing data is <a href="satellites.wearejust.com"target="_blank"></a> This website allows users to see objects around the parts atmosphere in real time. It uses data from other sources to produce a unique 3D earth with the objects floating around. Showcasing various objects such as payload, debris and rockets bodies existing around the atmosphere. Depending on the uses device there are multiple ways to interact with the website. On mobile you can move around your device to browse around and on a computer you can use external peripherals for navigation. Aside from displaying the location of the objects it also provides some interactive information. This includes the classification, timestamp and name the source has given. This is a unique way to showcase the quantity of these objects in a more understanding and visual format than graphs and tables.<p>
